# BACE Timebank - UX / Visual Design

## UX

* How do actually people use the time bank?
* How might they want to use it in the future?

## Notes

* Most people don't pay attention to the credit hours - since the code is down & it will take a while to get back up, most of the activity is focused on meeting up in intimate groups at pot luck
* When people exchange it's a very personal act. They usually don't pay attention to hours exchanged.
* Negotiating & bartering is taken place directly
