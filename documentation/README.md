# BACE Documentation

We are open source, giving our developers plenty of autonomy to experiment and have fun!

## UX

There's a lot of nice tidbits we've picked up from the people who have participated in offshoots.

I'll go more into this later. There are a lot of talented 

* Time element, accounting isn't as important as we thought - software never worked, people just ignored this element
* Focus on community & meeting in person & sharing

## Code

## What's out there 

* Rails App, looks decent on mobile http://timebanksf.herokuapp.com/info
* Bace Timebank iOS App - throwing this up soon on github, using a Parse backend 


## REST API

__Please make REST API a #1 priority__ so that we are not bottlenecked :) & we can draw more creatives, native mobile & designers into the project

## Database Schema

TBD - Omnigraffle
