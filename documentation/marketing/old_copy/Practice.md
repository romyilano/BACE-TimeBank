Bay Area Community Exchange Timebank

The Timebank is a free online directory that covers the entire bay area. It's an open source accounting system that encourages community self-help by facilitating exchanges of services and goods.

For every hour you spend doing something for someone in your community, you earn one hour to give to someone to do something for you. The currency is time and everyone's time is equal.

How to make a Timebank Exchange

Timebank exchanges work with request and offers.

A request is when you need a service, or good.

An offer is when you have a service, or good you want to share.
Example 1. You need help moving a sofa.
Option - Create a request asking for help with the amount of time it should take and date it needs to be done by.

Example 2. You want to start a garden.
Option â€“ Create a request for a local green thumb. 

Example 3. You have extra pumpkins from your garden.
Option - Create an offer with an hour value for your goods.

Example 4. You can help organize a cluttered room.
Option - Create an offer with an estimate of the time it will take to complete.


You can also use the timebank by searching the directory and profiles with the keyword search function and contact members directly to see if they have something to exchange.

You can talk to people in person or gather at a community event and agree to give credit through the timebank after the exchange.
The person who received the service, or goods transfers the agreed upon number of hours to the person who shared the service, or goods.

Go to the Profile Page of the person you want to transfer hours to.
Under the profile picture, click on "Give Credit" and send some words of thanks..
